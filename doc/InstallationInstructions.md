Installation instructions {#InstallationInstructions}
======

**Note: It is recommended to use the [Visual Studio Code dev-container](https://github.com/dafer45/TBTKDevContainer) as long as you only need to run calculations on your local computer. Ensuring the relevant dependencies are correctly installed is a difficult problem. Only follow these instructions if you need a custom install, e.g. because you cannot use Docker, need to run on a custom configured supercomputer, or need access to special hardware such as GPU.**

# Download TBTK {#DownloadTBTK}

```cpp
	git clone https://github.com/dafer45/TBTK/
```

# Select version
Always work agains a public release.
This is done by checking out the latset release using
```cpp
	git checkout v2.6.5
```
A full list of public releases can be found at https://github.com/dafer45/TBTK/releases.
By remembering the version number that an application is compiled with, it is guaranted that the application will be possible to build again anytime in the future.

TBTK uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
This means that any application that compiles with v2.x.y also will work with any higher version v2.x'.y'.
An update to the first (major) version number may break older applications.

# Install TBTK {#InstallTBTK}
## Unix like operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS
Begin by creating a build folder in parallel with the TBTK source folder (i.e. not inside).
```cpp
	mkdir TBTKBuild
```
The folder structure should now be
```cpp
	SomeFolder/
		TBTK
		TBTKBuild
```
Then do the following.
```cpp
	cd TBTKBuild
	cmake ../TBTK
	make
	sudo make install
```

## Local installation
It is possible to perform a local install if administrator privileges are not available.
To do so, add the flag -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install/path/ to the *cmake* call above, where install/path/ is the preferred installation path.
Make sure to also set the environment variables CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH, LIBRARY_PATH, and PATH if this is done.
The paths should be install/path/include/, install/path/lib/, and install/path/bin/, respectively.

## Customized installation
It is possible to customize the build by passing these flags to cmake.
| Flag                             | Description                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=XXX  | Specify a custom insallation path. For example a local path if administrator privileges are not available. |
| -DARPACK_LIBRARY_PATH:PATH=XXX   | Specify a non standard search path for ARPACK library files.                                               |
| -DSUPER_LU_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=XXX | Specify a non standard search path for SuperLU include files.                                              |
| -DSUPER_LU_LIBRARY_PATH:PATH=XXX | Specify a non standard search path for SuperLU library files.                                              |

where XXX is to be replaced by the relevant path.

# Update TBTK {#UpdateTBTK}
If TBTK is already installed, it can be updated to v2.6.5 as follows.
We here assume that TBTK has been downloaded and built in two parallel folders TBTK and TBTKBuild, as described above.
```cpp
	cd TBTK
	git pull
	git checkout v2.6.5
	cd ../TBTKBuild
	cmake ../TBTK
	make
	sudo make install
```
